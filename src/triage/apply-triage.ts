/**
 * Triage apply station — the security boundary of the triage flow.
 *
 * This is a `deterministic`, `effectful` station. There is NO model call in
 * this file, and that is the point: everything upstream of it (`classify`,
 * `scan`) is a transform reading attacker-authored text, so every guarantee
 * about what triage can DO has to live here, in code, in this repo, where a
 * change to it shows up in a diff.
 *
 * The one rule: the model classifies, this file acts, and the set of actions
 * is a closed enumeration. `classify` fills in fields whose legal values were
 * fixed in advance; nothing it emits is ever treated as the name of an action.
 *
 * Three label tiers (see LABEL_TIERS):
 *   AUTO   — applied without a human. Reversible, cheap when wrong.
 *   PROPOSE— named in the comment; a maintainer applies them.
 *   NEVER  — dismissals and release state. Not reachable from model output.
 *
 * A label outside the allowlist is DROPPED, never created. `area` has no
 * corresponding labels in this repo, so it reaches the comment and applies
 * nothing — the allowlist doing its job on a field we deliberately left
 * unmapped.
 *
 * Dry-run is the default. TRIAGE_APPLY=1 is what turns on the GitHub write,
 * matching the burn-in-then-promote pattern blackbox.yml and docs.yml use.

 * and is precisely what an injection aims at. `good first issue` / `help
