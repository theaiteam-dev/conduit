/**
 * claude-headless harness adapter (WI-564).
 *
 * The first shipping real HarnessAdapter (WI-560). Builds a `claude -p`
 * invocation from engine config, spawns it through the bounded process runner
 * (WI-561) with the env allowlist (WI-562), parses the harness's STRUCTURED
 * JSON usage/cost output (never scraped from free text), and translates the
 * station's declared `tools` allowlist into claude's `--allowed-tools` flag.
 *
 * Issue #28: a station's named agent becomes `--agent`, and engine-config
 * plugin dirs become one `--plugin-dir` each. Issue #29: with `isolateConfig`
 * the child gets a run-scoped CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR instead of the operator's
 * ~/.claude (claude-config-isolation.ts).
 *
 * `outputs` is always `[]` — the executor collects declared outputs from disk
 * (findMissingDeclaredOutputs in executor.ts); the claude JSON payload carries
 * no file manifest, so this adapter never fabricates output references.
 *
 * Do NOT touch ./harness.ts (unrelated worker-pool subprocess harness).
