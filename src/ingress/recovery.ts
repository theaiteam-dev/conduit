/**
 * Boot-time bounded re-drive and escalation for recoverable ingress events (WI-407).
 *
 * On listener startup, redriveOnBoot deterministically recovers:
 *   - 'accepted' rows — a crash between record and spawn (event recorded, launch never ran)
 *   - 'failed' rows still under the attempt cap (transient failure, re-drive eligible)
 *
 * Design invariants (enforced by the test suite):
 *   1. The RespawnSeam is LAUNCH-ONLY — it must not touch ingress_events or
 *      ingress_log. redriveOnBoot owns all bookkeeping: increment → launch → mark → log.
 *   2. Re-drive does NOT re-enter WI-406's accept-gate (which would dedup 'accepted'
 *      rows). This function snapshots listRedrivable(cap) once, then for each row:
 *      incrementSpawnAttempts BEFORE calling the seam, marks spawn_state from the
 *      result, and appends an 'redriven' ingress_log entry.
 *   3. Attempt counting is CONTINUOUS with WI-406: the first spawn already counted
 *      as attempt 1. With cap=N, a row at N is at the boundary (excluded);
 *      a row at N-1 is re-driven exactly once, incrementing it to N.
 *   4. A 'permanent_failure' result exhausts the row's spawn_attempts to >= cap
 *      so that listRedrivable skips it on the next boot (no unbounded auto-retry).
 *   5. Every FAILURE outcome fires the alert seam, exactly as the hot spawn path
 *      does (#8) — a launch that fails permanently or transiently, and a launched
 *      child that dies. Alerting is bookkeeping, so it lives here rather than in
 *      the launch-only seam (invariant 1), and it is BEST EFFORT: fireRedriveAlert
 *      is started but never awaited, so neither a throwing alert nor one that
 *      never settles can block markIngressFailed, the ingress_log entry, or the
 *      slot release. Before this, a re-driven failure only reached ingress_log,
 *      so a halted run stayed silent on every operator channel.
 *   6. The seam resolves on LAUNCH, not on exit (the original acknowledgement-on-accept work). A sweep therefore
 *      finishes in milliseconds instead of running as long as the runs it
 *      recovered, and boot no longer waits out a recovered render before the
 *      listener serves. The launched child keeps its run slot until it exits and
 *      is marked failed there if it dies (watchRedrivenChildExit).
 *
 * Mirrors the increment-before-effect discipline from the kernel outbox
 * (src/checkpoint/checkpoint.ts): the increment is persisted before the launch,
 * so a crash mid-re-drive still stays bounded on the next boot.
