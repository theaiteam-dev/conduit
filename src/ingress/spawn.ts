/**
 * WI-406 — Atomic accept-dedup-spawn orchestration (SPEC §9 / NFR-2, NFR-3, FR-1, FR-7).
 *
 * runSpawnPath is the listener's core path for a valid event. It:
 *   1. Builds and projects the substrate envelope (WI-403 composition) and
 *      derives the event's run id (the original ingress-attribution work) — pure, so it happens first.
 *   2. Atomically records the event_id as 'accepted' before spawning (NFR-2),
 *      with attribution (flow, payload, run id) in the same statement so any
 *      later re-drive can relaunch the event faithfully — then claims a run
 *      slot (the original listener-backpressure work): if all slots are busy the row STAYS 'accepted' and the
 *      re-drive sweep launches it when a slot frees ('queued' outcome).
 *   3. Counts the spawn attempt before calling the spawn seam — crash recovery
 *      leaves a countable 'accepted' row for boot re-drive (FR-1, AC8).
 *   4. Calls the spawn seam (Bun.spawn abstracted for testability) with the
 *      flow path, inline substrate, and derived run id.
 *   5. On a successful LAUNCH: marks 'spawned' + appends an 'accepted' log entry
 *      and returns — the caller acks here (the original acknowledgement-on-accept work).
 *   6. On a failed launch: marks 'failed' (no double-count), resolves the alert
 *      channel, fires the alert seam, and appends a 'spawn_failed' log entry.
 *   7. After a successful launch the child's EXIT is handled off the request
 *      path (watchChildExit): a non-zero exit gets the same FR-7 treatment as a
 *      failed launch — unless the run PARKED behind a provider rate limit
 *      (issue #7, ./parked.ts) — and the run slot is released there.
 *
 * Launch vs exit (the original acknowledgement-on-accept work). The seam resolves when the child is LAUNCHED, not
 * when it finishes; it reports the child's terminal state through the optional
 * `exited` promise. Before this split the production seam awaited `proc.exited`,
 * so runSpawnPath — and with it the webhook's HTTP response — stayed pending for
 * the entire run (hours, for a render). Consequently:
 *
 *   - spawn_state 'spawned' now means LAUNCHED, not "ran to a clean exit". A
 *     listener crash mid-run leaves the row 'spawned', so ingress re-drive no
 *     longer covers it; the run's own resume/journal machinery owns recovery
 *     from that point (and a re-driven completed run would dedupe at the run
 *     layer anyway, so the coverage was nominal).
 *   - the run slot is held from launch to child exit, so max_concurrent_runs
 *     keeps meaning concurrent RUNS rather than concurrent webhook responses.
 *
 * Only the two outermost I/O effects — spawn and alert — are seamed. All
 * persistence and envelope logic uses the real modules (WI-401, WI-403, WI-404).
