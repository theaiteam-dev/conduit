/**
 * Parked runs under the ingress listener (issue #7).
 *
 * A run the consumption andon halts while every unfinished card waits on a
 * provider reset exits 1 — "did not complete" — and is recorded
 * `runs.status='halted', outcome='parked'` by the CLI (run/run-state.ts). To
 * the listener that exit looked like any other failure: the row went 'failed',
 * the channel was told "exited with code 1", and the boot sweep then
 * "re-drove" it with `conduit run --run-id <same>` — which, for an existing
 * run, only prints the run state and exits 0. The run was never resumed.
 *
 * A park is a RUN-level fact, so the ingress_events spawn_state machine stays
 * untouched: the row stays 'spawned' (its launch succeeded) and the ledger
 * keeps tracking launches. This module owns the two things the listener needs
 * on top of that:
 *
 *   - recognising a park at child exit (inspectParkedRun) and telling the
 *     channel ONCE per event that the run is waiting and will resume on its own
 *     (recordPark) — the MAX park cap chunks a long reset into several
 *     resume/park cycles, and the channel should not hear each chunk;
 *   - resuming what is due with `conduit resume` on every sweep
 *     (resumeDueParkedRuns), slot-gated WITHOUT the HITL bypass: a rate limit is
 *     precisely the wrong moment to let N parked runs stampede a saturated box.
 *
 * Attempts are never spent here: `spawn_attempts` bounds LAUNCH failures, and
 * neither a park nor its resume is one. Only a resume that ends with the run
 * neither complete nor parked is a failure, and it is reported exactly as a
 * dead re-driven child is: the row goes 'failed' and this sweep stops looking
 * at it — only 'spawned' events are resume candidates. That hand-off is what
 * bounds the loop: a resume can fail BEFORE it drives the run at all (a lease
 * conflict, a preflight failure, a missing flow file), leaving the run parked
 * with its gate in the past; re-resuming it every tick would spend nothing
 * and never end. A 'failed' row is the re-drive sweep's business, and that
 * sweep is attempt-capped — its `conduit run --run-id` re-drive of an
 * existing run is a no-op that flips the row back to 'spawned' while counting
 * an attempt, so the whole resume/fail/re-drive cycle is bounded by
 * `redriveCap`.

/**
 * Record a park: an ingress_log 'parked' entry EVERY time, the alert ONCE per
 * event — for the life of the event, not per park sequence. "Once" is keyed on
 * the log itself, so it survives a listener restart and needs no state of its
 * own. Informational — it never marks the event failed, and a dead alert
 * transport never throws past here. A caller with no alert seam (a unit-level
 * re-drive driver) just gets the log entry.
 *
 * Per-event rather than per-sequence is deliberate, and it is the weaker of two
 * bad options. The MAX park cap chunks one long reset into several
 * resume/park cycles, and by the time a chunk re-parks the previous chunk's
 * gate has always passed — so any "has the last gate expired?" rule re-alerts
 * on every chunk, which is the noise this suppression exists to prevent.
 * Nothing here can separate a chunk from a genuinely new cap without asking
 * whether the run made progress in between.
 *
 * What keeps that from meaning "the operator is told once and then never
 * again" is the kernel, not the listener: MAX_CONSECUTIVE_RATE_LIMIT_PARKS
 * (controller/executor.ts) escalates a card that keeps parking without progress
 * to `hold`. A held card is not parked, so the run stops being auto-resumed and
 * its next exit takes the FAILURE path — mark, alert, log — which is the loud
 * ending a cap that never clears is supposed to get.
 *
 * Resolves once the LOG is durable; the alert is started but not awaited, so a
 * transport that never settles cannot hold up the caller (see below).
