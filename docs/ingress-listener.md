# Ingress Listener

The ingress listener is a long-lived process that accepts external events (webhook POST requests, Slack messages) and spawns deterministic conduit runs. It is separate from the per-run kernel—no model calls, no tick loop, just reception and forwarding.

## Overview

### What it solves

Conduit flows run in response to external triggers (a GitHub webhook, a Slack message, a scheduled event from a queue). The listener:

1. **Receives events** from multiple sources (webhook, Slack)
2. **Authenticates them** (signature verification, shared secret)
3. **Deduplicates them** exactly-once—a retry of the same event never spawns two runs
4. **Recovers from crashes** between acceptance and spawn—an unspawned event is not lost
5. **Bounds recovery** by attempt cap—no unbounded retry loops
6. **Fails loudly at boot**—invalid flow config, route collisions, missing bindings abort startup

### Key guarantees

- **Deterministic dedup**: The same event_id always produces the same run (or none if duplicate)
- **Bounded recovery**: Crashed-but-unspawned events are recovered on restart, capped by attempt limit
- **Fail-closed auth**: Invalid signature/secret rejected before any database write
- **No model calls at rest**: Zero cost while idle
- **One spawned run per distinct event**: No accidental double-billing

## Architecture

```
External Event (webhook/Slack)
    ↓
[Adapter: verify auth, resolve route]
    ↓
[Core accept-spawn path]
  - Atomic: acceptIngressEvent (spawn_state='accepted')
  - Derive: event_id (per binding rules)
  - Build: substrate envelope (deterministic, secret-filtered)
  - Launch: conduit run via Bun.spawn
  - Mark: spawn_state='spawned' (launched) or 'failed'
  - Log: outcome to ingress_log
  - Ack: respond to the caller HERE — the run is still executing
    ↓
Conduit run launched OR logged as rejected/duplicate
    ↓
[Child exit, asynchronously]
  - Non-zero: spawn_state='failed' + alert + 'spawn_failed' log entry — unless
    the run PARKED behind a provider rate limit (`runs.outcome='parked'`, exit
    code 1): then the row stays `'spawned'`, a `'parked'` log entry is written,
    and the listener resumes the run once its gate passes (see Re-drive logic)
  - Clean: nothing further; the row stays 'spawned'
  - Either way: release the run slot
```

### Ack on accept

The webhook response is produced as soon as the event is accepted and its
`conduit run` child is **launched** — not when the run finishes. A response is:

| Outcome | Status | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted` — a run is now executing | `202` | `{"outcome":"accepted","run_id":"…"}` |
| `queued` — accepted, waiting on a free run slot | `202` | `{"outcome":"queued","run_id":"…"}` |
| `duplicate` — already handled | `200` | `{"outcome":"duplicate"}` |
| `spawn_failed` — the launch failed; the sweep owns the retry | `200` | `{"outcome":"spawn_failed"}` |

Before this, the response waited on the child's **exit**, so a multi-hour render
held the HTTP socket open for hours: every real client timed out and marked
accepted work as failed. Generic providers (GitHub, Stripe) time out after
~10–30s, so they would re-deliver or mark the delivery failed as well.

### The listener process

```
[Boot]
  1. Load flow allowlist (explicit, not auto-discovery)
  2. Read channels.ingress from each flow
  3. Validate all bindings (malformed?, route collision?)
  4. Resolve alert channels per flow (flow.egress || listener-global)
  5. Re-drive recoverable events (bounded by cap)
  6. Start HTTP server (webhook adapter)
  7. Register Slack event handler
    ↓
[Idle]
  - Accept events
  - Authenticate
  - Spawn runs
  - Log outcomes
    ↓
[Crash → Restart]
  - Re-drive unspawned events (bounded)
  - Resume from last clean state
```

## Configuration

### Flow allowlist

Explicit, not auto-discovery. Only flows named in the allowlist are triggerable:

```bash
conduit listen --flows flow1.yaml,flow2.yaml \
  --global-alert-channel #conduit-alerts
```

Or via config file:

```json
{
  "flows": ["flow1.yaml", "flow2.yaml"],
  "globalAlertChannel": "#conduit-alerts"
}
```

### Run backpressure (`max_concurrent_runs`)

By default the listener spawns a `conduit run` for every accepted event immediately — N
simultaneous events means N concurrent runs. Against a serial model endpoint that is a
thundering herd: every transform queues behind every other, hits its station timeout, and
the burst grinds into redrive-cap exhaustion.

`max_concurrent_runs` caps how many spawned runs are in flight at once, listener-wide
(across all hosted flows — the model box is the shared bottleneck):

```bash
conduit listen --manifest engine.yaml --max-concurrent-runs 1
```

or in the engine manifest:

```yaml
flows:
  pic-edit: ./flows/pic-edit/flow.yaml
max_concurrent_runs: 1
```

Precedence: `--max-concurrent-runs` flag > manifest `max_concurrent_runs` >
`CONDUIT_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` env. Omitted → unlimited (the original behavior).

Events beyond the cap are still accepted and recorded (`ingress_events` row in
`'accepted'`, ingress_log outcome `'queued'`) — nothing is dropped, and the provider gets
its ack. Queued events launch **in arrival order** as slots free: a completed run kicks
the re-drive sweep immediately, so a `max_concurrent_runs: 1` burst of 8 photos processes
serially back-to-back with no interval wait. Because queued rows are ordinary `'accepted'`
rows, a listener crash loses nothing — boot re-drive picks the queue back up.

Queueing is not a spawn attempt: a queued event's `spawn_attempts` is untouched until it
actually launches, so the redrive cap still bounds real launches only.

**HITL resumes participate opportunistically — and deliberately bypass the cap under
saturation.** A reply-triggered `conduit resume` claims a run slot when one is
free, so accounting stays honest in the common case. When every slot is busy it proceeds
anyway: a pick resumes work that was already admitted once, arrives at human latency, and
a human's selection queueing behind a photo backlog would read as a broken reply loop. So
under saturation the true process count can exceed `max_concurrent_runs` by the number of
in-flight resumes. A second concurrent resume for the *same* run is suppressed (logged
`'duplicate'`) — the double-driver guard; the run lease remains the backstop for resumes
that bypassed the gate.

### Per-flow binding declaration

In `flow.yaml`, declare `channels.ingress`:

```yaml
channels:
  ingress:
    - type: webhook
      route: /webhook/github
      auth:
        shared_secret: env:GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
      event_id:
        from: header
        name: X-GitHub-Delivery

    - type: slack
      event_id:
        from: json_path
        path: $.event_id

    # Slack over Socket Mode — no public HTTPS endpoint required.
    # The listener opens an OUTBOUND wss connection; auth is the app-level
    # token, so no `auth` block (request signing never runs on this transport).
    - type: slack
      transport: socket            # 'events' (default, webhook) | 'socket'
      channel: C-STUDIO
      app_token_env: SLACK_APP_TOKEN   # xapp-…, scope connections:write
      event_id:
        from: json_path
        path: $.event_id

  egress: []  # optional; if omitted, uses global alert channel

```

### Event ID derivation

How does the listener derive a stable `event_id` (used for dedup)?

| Source | Mode | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **header** | Named HTTP header | `X-Idempotency-Key: abc123` → event_id = `abc123` |
| **json_path** | Path in JSON body | body `{"event_id": "evt_789"}` → event_id = `evt_789` |
| **content_hash** | SHA256 of body | deterministic hash of request body |
| **require** | Strict mode | Event rejected if ID cannot be derived |

### Smart defaults

- **Slack**: Defaults to `body.event_id` (Slack's native event ID)
- **Webhook** (no explicit source): Probes well-known headers in order:
  1. `X-Conduit-Delivery-Id`
  2. `Idempotency-Key`
  3. `X-GitHub-Delivery`
  4. `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`
  5. `X-Request-Id`
  6. `body.id` (Stripe-style)
  7. **Fallback**: Content-hash with one-time degraded-dedup warning

### Auth

#### Webhook (mandatory shared secret)

```yaml
auth:
  shared_secret: env:WEBHOOK_SECRET  # or literal: abc123
```

Verification: HMAC request body signature (algorithm depends on provider; webhook.ts verifies the request matches expected signature).

#### Slack (request signing)

```yaml
auth:
  signing_secret: env:SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
```

Verification: HMAC-SHA256 of `timestamp + ':' + raw_body`, compared against `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp` and `X-Slack-Signature`. Replay window: ±5 minutes (configurable).

#### Authentication failures

- **Missing/invalid signature**: Reject with 401, log `rejected_auth`, **never** spawn or accept
- **Fail-closed**: The request is denied before any database write

#### Slack Socket Mode (`transport: socket`)

No per-request verification exists on this transport — the outbound wss
connection itself is the auth, established by `apps.connections.open` with the
app-level token named in `app_token_env`. Guard that token accordingly.

Boot is fail-loud, not fail-closed-at-runtime (a socket client has no request
to reject — an unset token would just retry-loop `invalid_auth` forever):

- `MISSING_APP_TOKEN` — the binding declares `transport: socket` without `app_token_env` (validation)
- `MISSING_APP_TOKEN_SECRET` — `app_token_env` names an env var that is not set (listener boot)
- `SOCKET_SEAM_UNAVAILABLE` — a socket flow is configured in an environment with no Socket Mode I/O

Everything after delivery is shared with the webhook transport: the same
channel→flow routing, event-id derivation, dedup ledger, and accept/spawn path.
Envelopes are acked (`envelope_id` echoed) *before* processing — the Socket
Mode equivalent of the fast HTTP 2xx; unacked envelopes are redelivered by
Slack and absorbed by dedup. Connection lifecycle: Slack recycles connections
(~hourly, `disconnect: refresh_requested`) — the replacement is opened before
the old socket closes; unexpected drops reconnect with 1s-doubling backoff
(30s cap); `disconnect: link_disabled` (app disabled) is terminal and logged,
never retried. Flows sharing one app token share one connection.

### Substrate mapping (optional)

Optional JSON-path projection—transform the event into a custom substrate shape:

```yaml
event_id:
  from: header
  name: X-Delivery-Id
substrate:
  message: $.text
  user_id: $.user.id
  timestamp: $.ts
```

Result: The spawned run's substrate carries only the fields named in the mapping (extracted via JSON path from the event).

Numeric path segments index into arrays, which is how array-shaped webhook
payloads (Slack `files[]`, GitHub `commits[]`, Stripe `lines.data[]`) are
projected:

```yaml
substrate:
  file_url: $.body.event.files.0.url_private_download
  thread_ts: $.body.event.ts
```

Indices must be canonical non-negative integers (`0`, `1`, `12` — no leading
zeros). An out-of-range index, like any other unresolvable path, yields the
field present with value `null`. The same dialect applies to
`event_id: { from: json_path }` paths — but note those resolve against the
request **body** directly, not the envelope, so drop the `$.body` prefix
(`$.event.files.0.id`, not `$.body.event.files.0.id`).

### Event filter (`when`)

A webhook binding may declare `when`: a list of conditions, all of which an
event must meet to be accepted. Each condition names one subject, a `header`
(matched case-insensitively) or a `json_path` into the request body, and one
test:

```yaml
when:
  - { header: X-GitHub-Event, in: [pull_request_review, issue_comment] }
  - { json_path: $.action, not_in: [deleted] }
  - { json_path: $.pull_request.number, present: true }
```

- `in` / `not_in` compare the resolved value as a string against a non-empty
  list (numbers and booleans in the list are written as their string form).
- `present: true|false` asks whether the subject exists and is not null,
  whatever its type. An object counts: GitHub marks an `issue_comment` on a
  pull request with an object at `$.issue.pull_request`, so
  `{ json_path: $.issue.pull_request, present: true }` keeps PR comments and
  drops comments on plain issues.
- For `in` and `not_in`, only a string, number, or boolean counts as
  resolved. An object, array, null, or missing value is in no list: `in`
  fails, `not_in` holds.
- Values are compared as strings. A resolved `42` or `"42"` matches both
  `in: [42]` and `in: ["42"]`, and `true` or `"true"` matches both
  `in: [true]` and `in: ["true"]`. Headers are always strings, so a typed
  comparison could not apply to every subject. `when` filters a delivery
  that has already passed auth; it is not access control.

A non-matching event is answered `200 {"outcome":"filtered"}` so the provider
does not retry it, logged `filtered`, and never written to `ingress_events`.
`when` works with or without `run_key`. Boot rejects a malformed condition
(`INVALID_WHEN`) and `when` on a slack or cli binding (`WHEN_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE`).

### One run per subject (`run_key`)

By default every delivery starts its own run (the run id is derived from the
event id). A webhook binding may instead declare `run_key`: the ordered parts
that identify the external subject an event is about. Every event with the
same key belongs to ONE run, and each event after the first becomes the next
**pass** of that run.

```yaml
channels:
  ingress:
    type: webhook
    route: /hooks/pr-review
    auth: { type: hmac, secret_env: GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET }
    event_id: { from: header, name: x-github-delivery }   # delivery dedup, unchanged
    when:
      - { header: X-GitHub-Event, in: [pull_request_review, issue_comment] }
    run_key:
      - { json_path: "$.repository.id" }
      - { json_path: ["$.pull_request.number", "$.issue.number"] }
    max_passes: 10          # optional; absent = unlimited
```

- Each part is `{ json_path: <path> }`, `{ json_path: [<path>, ...] }`
  (alternatives: the first that resolves to a non-empty scalar within the
  512-character limit wins; an alternative over that limit is skipped like an
  unresolved one, so a later, shorter alternative can still resolve the part),
  or `{ header: <name> }`. Paths use the same `$.` dialect as `substrate`,
  rooted at the request body.
- Only non-empty scalar values count. If any part does not resolve, the event
  is refused: `400`, logged `rejected_run_key`, never accepted. There is no
  content-hash fallback, since a fallback key would quietly give the event a
  run of its own. A part is refused the same way when every alternative is
  either unresolved or over 512 characters.
- The run id is `igk-<flow>-<hash>`, where the hash covers the flow id and the
  ordered parts, so two flows keyed on the same subject never share a run.
  Leave out anything that changes as the flow works (a head SHA, for a flow
  that pushes).
- `run_key`, `when`, and `max_passes` are webhook-only. On a slack or cli
  binding they fail boot (`RUN_KEY_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE`, `WHEN_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE`,
  `INVALID_MAX_PASSES`). `max_passes` also requires `run_key`.
- A keyed binding's `substrate` may not name `run_key`, `pass`, `events` or
  `events_truncated` (`RESERVED_SUBSTRATE_FIELD`): the listener stamps all
  four onto every keyed pass's substrate (see below). Unkeyed substrates are
  unchanged.

Delivery dedup is unchanged: a retried delivery is still a `duplicate`. What
an accepted keyed event does depends on its run:

| Run state | What happens | Logged |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| No run yet | Launch pass 1 (`conduit run --run-id <keyed id>`) | `accepted` |
| A pass is in flight (launching, running, resuming, queued behind busy slots) or the run is parked | The event is folded into the run's **pending** pass | `coalesced` |
| Holding a card for a human (HITL pick, integrity hard-pause) | The event becomes the pending pass; the channel is told once that events are waiting | `coalesced` |
| Previous pass concluded: every card in `done` or `scrap`, none held | Launch the next pass (`conduit run --append-pass`) | `accepted` |
| Concluded, `max_passes` reached | Nothing launched | `pass_limit` |
| Stopped with unfinished cards (the andon halted it mid-pass) or crashed mid-pass | Nothing launched | `run_not_appendable` |
| A pass already consumed this event (a re-drive of a launch whose exit was lost) | Nothing launched; the event is marked `spawned` | `already_applied` |

A pass that scrapped has concluded, so the subject keeps taking passes: an
unattended loop treats a scrapped pass as a bad outcome, not a stuck run. When
a pass exits non-zero after concluding that way, its event stays `spawned` (it
is not re-driven as a fresh pass), the log records `pass_failed` with the
reason, the channel is alerted, and the pending event launches as usual. Only
a non-zero exit that leaves the run unable to take a pass marks the event
`failed` for the re-drive sweep.

When a pass's child exits, the pending event (if any) launches as exactly one
more pass: six review comments posted during one pass produce one trailing
pass. That pass covers all six. Its substrate's top-level fields are the
latest event's, and four more fields describe the pass:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `run_key` | The resolved key parts |
| `pass` | The pass number |
| `events` | Every event the pass covers, oldest first, the latest last. Each entry is `{ event_id, received_at, substrate }` |
| `events_truncated` | `true` when the list was cut: it holds at most 50 events and 64 KiB, and the oldest are dropped first |

A flow reads `events` to act on each change. It needs to fetch the subject's
state from its source only when `events_truncated` is true.

The kernel records which events each pass consumed. The listener passes the
covered event ids to `conduit run` as `--pass-event`, and the kernel writes
them to `run_pass_events` in the same transaction that seeds the pass's entry
card. Before launching an event, the listener checks that table. If the
listener lost a pass's exit (the child's handle was lost, or the listener
restarted) and the sweep picks the event up again, the event is marked
`spawned` and logged `already_applied` instead of running a second time.

The periodic sweep also drains pending passes, which is how a pending
pass survives a listener restart and follows a parked-run or HITL resume. A
pass that loses the run lease to another driver (exit 75) becomes pending
rather than failed.

A `pass_limit` or `run_not_appendable` refusal, and events waiting on a held
run, alert the channel **once per run**, not once per event; every event is
still logged. The flag clears when a pass launches, so a run that is repaired
and blocks again is reported again. Resume a run with unfinished cards, or a
crashed one, with `conduit resume` to let it take passes again. A held run
needs no such step: the human's reply resumes it, and its pending pass follows.

Passes take a run slot like any launch and never bypass `max_concurrent_runs`.
Their slot is registered per run, so two launches for one run never overlap.
The run's token budget (`budgets.run.max_tokens`) is a ceiling over all its
passes: each pass may spend only what earlier passes left, and a run with none
left refuses the next pass. `conduit resume` of a run that has taken more than
one pass applies the same ceiling, and refuses the resume when nothing is left. The wall-clock budget applies to each pass on its
own. Card, checkpoint, and journal state are per card, so a pass never replays
an earlier pass's work; a fan-out in a later pass must propose child ids the
run has not used (a reused id holds the parent with `child_id_collision`).
Per-run keyed state (key, `max_passes`, pending event, alert flag) is kept in
the `ingress_keyed_runs` table, and which pass consumed each event in
`run_pass_events`.

## The durability ledger

### ingress_events table

Records every event ever seen. Columns:

- `event_id` (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY): Stable event identifier
- `received_at` (INTEGER): Timestamp of arrival
- `spawn_state` (TEXT): One of `accepted | spawned | failed`
- `spawn_attempts` (INTEGER): Number of spawn attempts (bounded by cap)

`spawned` means **launched**, not "ran to a clean exit." A run that
dies after launch moves the row back to `failed` from the exit watcher, so the
bounded re-drive still picks it up; a run that is still executing sits in
`spawned` with its run slot held. A run that **parks** behind a provider rate
limit (its own row says `status='halted', outcome='parked'`) also exits
non-zero but is not a failure: it stays `spawned` and is **resumed**, never
re-driven — a park is a run-level fact on the `runs` row, not a launch state.

### State machine transitions

```
         Initial receive
              ↓
      acceptIngressEvent
              ↓
       spawn_state='accepted'
         spawn_attempts=0
              ↓
    [Spawn attempt] (incrementSpawnAttempts → 1)
        /        \
   Launched    Launch failed
      ↓            ↓
   'spawned'     'failed'
      ↓            ↓
 [child exits] (try again, bounded)
   /      \
 code 0   code≠0 → 'failed' (+ alert, bounded re-drive)
   ↓          ↳ run parked (runs.outcome='parked') → stays 'spawned'
 (done)         (+ 'parked' log entry, one informational alert,
                 `conduit resume` from the sweep once the gate passes)
```

### Re-drive logic

On listener startup, `redriveOnBoot`:

1. List all rows where `spawn_state IN ('accepted', 'failed')` AND `spawn_attempts < CAP`
2. For each row:
   - Increment `spawn_attempts` (before the spawn)
   - Re-invoke the core spawn path
   - Mark `'spawned'` on success, or `'failed'` on failure
   - On failure, fire the alert seam — same payload and channel resolution as
     the hot path (the flow's first egress target, else the listener-global
     channel); a pre-v9 row with no flow attribution alerts on the global
     channel as `flow=unknown`
   - Log outcome as `'redriven'` to ingress_log

   A re-driven child that later exits non-zero gets the same treatment from its
   exit watcher: `'failed'` + alert (`re-driven run exited with code N`) +
   a `'spawn_failed'` log entry. Alerting is best effort and fire-and-forget —
   the alert is started but never awaited, so neither a throwing alert seam nor
   one whose promise never settles blocks the mark, the log entry, or the
   run-slot release.

3. Rows at-cap or with permanent failures are **not** re-driven. A permanent
   failure is the loudest case: the row is excluded from every future sweep, so
   its alert is the only thing that will surface the event again.

**Parked runs are resumed, not re-driven.** A run that halted behind a provider
rate limit exits 1, but its `runs` row reads `status='halted', outcome='parked'`
and its cards are `ready` behind a future `release_at`. Both exit watchers
check that (the runs row, confirmed against the cards) before marking failed:
a parked run keeps its row `spawned`, writes a `'parked'` log entry naming the
run id and the gate (ISO-8601 UTC), and fires one informational alert per
event (the first park only — a long reset is chunked into several park cycles
and the channel should not hear each one; a cap that never clears ends loudly
instead, see below). It is never re-driven — `conduit run --run-id <existing>` only prints
the run's state — so `spawn_attempts` is untouched.

After the boot re-drive, and again after every periodic sweep (the same
schedule and the same slot-release kick — no second timer), the listener
resumes every parked ingress run whose gate has passed with
`conduit resume <flow.yaml> --run <runId>`, soonest gate first. Resumes draw
from the run-slot pool **without** the HITL bypass: a rate limit is exactly
the wrong moment to let N parked runs stampede a saturated model box, so the
first run to find no free slot ends the sweep and the rest wait for the kick.
A resume already in flight for the same run is suppressed (`'duplicate'`).
When the resumed child exits the run is re-inspected: complete → an
`'accepted'` entry; parked again (the per-park cap chunks a long reset into
several cycles) → another `'parked'` entry, no new alert, and the next due
sweep picks it up; neither → **now** it is a failure: `'failed'` + alert +
`'spawn_failed'`, exactly as a dead re-driven child — and the parked sweep then
leaves it to the attempt-capped re-drive sweep, since only `spawned` events are
resume candidates. That hand-off bounds the loop: a resume that fails before it
drives the run (lease conflict, preflight, missing flow file) leaves the run
parked with its gate in the past, and re-resuming it every tick would never
end; instead the re-drive sweep's `conduit run --run-id` no-op flips the row
back to `spawned` while counting an attempt, so the cycle is bounded by the
cap. A parked run with no ingress attribution (a CLI-triggered run) is not the
listener's to resume.

A resume is also skipped for any event whose launch is already in flight in
this process: the boot re-drive resolves on **launch** and marks the row
`spawned` before the parked sweep runs, so a row it just re-drove is otherwise
immediately a resume candidate and the two drivers race for the run lease.
The re-drive sweep guards the same way, but registers its slot under the event
id while a resume registers under `parked-resume:<runId>`, so the parked sweep
checks `inFlight(eventId)` itself.

**The park loop terminates.** A park spends no execution attempt, so none of
the four rework guards bounds it, and this sweep would otherwise resume a
permanently-capped run forever on one alert. The kernel bounds it instead: a
card that parks `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_RATE_LIMIT_PARKS` times in a row without
making progress hard-pauses to `hold`. A held card is not parked, so the run
drops off this sweep and its next exit takes the ordinary failure path —
`'failed'` + alert + `'spawn_failed'`.

### Attempt cap semantics

Default cap: 3 attempts (configurable).

- Attempt 1: Initial spawn (WI-406)
- Attempt 2–3: Re-drives on restart (WI-407)
- Attempt 4+: At-cap, not re-driven (surfaced as alert)

A row at `spawn_attempts=2` is re-drivable once; after re-drive it becomes `spawn_attempts=3` and is no longer re-drivable.

## Observability

### ingress_log table

Append-only journal of all event outcomes. Columns:

- `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
- `source` (TEXT): `'webhook' | 'slack' | ...`
- `event_id` (TEXT, nullable)
- `outcome` (TEXT): One of:
  - `'accepted'` — Event accepted, spawned run
  - `'duplicate'` — Same event_id already processed
  - `'rejected_auth'` — Auth failed
  - `'rejected_unknown_flow'` — Route does not match any flow
  - `'rejected_malformed'` — Body unparseable
  - `'spawn_failed'` — Spawn succeeded, conduit run had an error
  - `'redriven'` — Re-drive attempt on restart
  - `'parked'` — The launched run halted parked behind a provider rate limit (`runs.outcome='parked'`); the row stays `spawned` and the sweep resumes it once its gate passes. Written on every park; the reason names the run id and the gate as ISO-8601 UTC
  - `'queued'` — Accepted, but all run slots busy (`max_concurrent_runs`); launches via the re-drive sweep as slots free
  - `'filtered'`: The binding's `when` conditions did not match; acked, never accepted
  - `'rejected_run_key'`: The binding declares `run_key` and a part did not resolve; refused with 400
  - `'coalesced'`: A keyed event folded into its run's pending pass
  - `'pass_limit'`: A keyed run already had `max_passes` passes
  - `'run_not_appendable'`: A keyed run stopped with unfinished cards, or crashed mid-pass
  - `'pass_failed'`: A keyed pass ran and concluded unsuccessfully (its cards are in `done` or `scrap`); the event stays `spawned` and the run takes its next pass
  - `'already_applied'`: A re-drive found that a pass already consumed the event (`run_pass_events`); the event is marked `spawned` and not launched again
- `reason` (TEXT, nullable): Human-readable reason
- `attributes_json` (TEXT, nullable): Event attributes (secret-filtered)

Secret filtering: Keys like `authorization`, `*_token` are dropped before storage.

### Alerts

When an event cannot be spawned, an alert is sent:

```
Flow: order-processing
Event ID: evt_abc123
Outcome: spawn_failed
Reason: Conduit run exited with non-zero status
```

Alert destination: Per-flow `channels.egress[0].target` (if declared), else listener-global fallback channel.

A **parked** run sends one informational alert per park sequence — the reason
starts with `parked` and names the run id and the gate time — so the channel
learns the run is waiting and will resume on its own. It is keyed on the
event's existing `'parked'` log entries, so a run that re-parks across several
resume/park cycles does not repeat it, and it never marks the event failed. A
resume that ends with the run neither complete nor parked alerts as a failure.

## Examples

### GitHub webhook → conduit run

1. GitHub sends POST to `/webhook/github` with X-GitHub-Delivery header
2. Listener verifies HMAC signature
3. Event ID derived from X-GitHub-Delivery
4. Substrate: GitHub event JSON (secret-filtered)
5. Conduit run spawned with substrate as input
6. Run processes the GitHub event deterministically

### Slack message → conduit run

1. Slack sends POST event to listener
2. Listener verifies HMAC-SHA256 signature
3. Event ID derived from event_id field
4. Substrate: Message text + attachments (secret-filtered)
5. Listener acks Slack within 3s
6. Conduit run spawned asynchronously
7. Slack retries (same event_id) are deduped (logged, not spawned)

### Crash recovery

1. Listener accepted event, marked `spawn_state='accepted'`, was about to spawn
2. Listener crashes
3. Event remains in DB with `spawn_state='accepted'`, `spawn_attempts=0`
4. Listener restarts
5. `redriveOnBoot` finds the row, increments attempts to 1, re-spawns
6. Run now launches; row marked `'spawned'`
7. No double-billing, no lost events

**What ingress re-drive does not cover:** a listener that dies
*after* a child was launched leaves the row `'spawned'`, so the sweep will not
re-drive it. Recovery from that point belongs to the run's own resume/journal
machinery (`conduit resume --run <id>`), which is the only layer that knows how
far the run got. This was already effectively true — a re-driven completed run
deduplicates at the run layer — but it is now explicit in the state.

## Testing

The ingress listener is tested at three levels:

1. **Unit tests** (per module):
   - `binding.test.ts`: Route collision, malformed bindings
   - `event-id.test.ts`: Header/json_path/content_hash derivation
   - `envelope.test.ts`: Deterministic envelope building, secret filtering
   - `spawn.test.ts`: Accept-dedup-spawn orchestration
   - `recovery.test.ts`: Bounded re-drive, attempt caps
   - `webhook.test.ts`: Signature verification, fail-closed auth
   - `slack-events.test.ts`: Request signing, 3s ack window

2. **Integration tests** (adapters + listener):
   - Boot validation (route collisions, missing flows)
   - Full webhook→spawn path
   - Full Slack→spawn path
   - Concurrent dedup (multiple identical events)

3. **Crash-recovery tests** (crash oracle):
   - Crash mid-accept (before spawn): event recovered on restart
   - Crash mid-spawn: attempt counting correct
   - Crash mid-re-drive: bounded by cap

## Migration notes

### From manual CLI to ingress listener

Before step 8.2, flows were triggered via CLI:

```bash
conduit run --flow flow.yaml --input-file event.json
```

With step 8.2, flows can be triggered by external events:

```bash
conduit listen --flows flow.yaml --global-alert-channel '#alerts'
```

The listener is **optional**—CLI seeding still works. A flow can be triggered either way.

### Database migrations

The ingress listener adds:

- `ingress_events` table (new columns: `spawn_state`, `spawn_attempts`)
- `ingress_log` table (new, journal connection)
- `ingress_keyed_runs` table (schema v11): per-run state for `run_key` bindings.
  Keyed events also use two further `spawn_state` values, `coalesced` and
  `refused`, neither of which is re-driven
- `run_pass_events` table (schema v11): which pass of a run consumed each
  ingress event, written by the kernel with the pass's entry card

Migrations are idempotent and additive:

- Shipped v3 databases are migrated v3→v4 on first open
- Fresh databases (v0) create both tables at init
- Existing databases retain all prior state (no destructive ALTER)

## Performance

- **Boot time**: O(flows * bindings) — validation + re-drive snapshot
- **Per-event**: O(1) atomic accept, O(log n) dedup lookup, ~10ms spawn invocation
- **Memory**: Minimal — no cached flow state, single DB connection
- **Disk I/O**: Write-ahead logging (WAL mode) for atomic accept + spawn_state transitions

## Limitations and future work

- **No async retry queue**: Permanent failures surface as alerts but don't auto-retry indefinitely (design: bounded cap prevents runaway)
- **No flow hot-reload**: Listener must restart to pick up flow changes (design: explicit allowlist prevents surprise triggering)
- **No rate limiting**: Event arrival rate is unbounded (future: add per-flow or per-route rate limits). Run *concurrency* is bounded via `max_concurrent_runs`; per-endpoint model-call queueing across runs and richer burst UX ("N queued, #k processing") remain future work
- **No event transformation**: Substrate is raw event + optional JSON-path projection (future: add full transformation stations if needed)
